# mech_pawn_patch

Patch to make various changes to mech pawns from "Persona Mechanoid Pawns":

- Mechs don't need sleep
- Disable comfort need (comfort bar still shows but pawn does not incur mood penalties from it)
- Persona mechs only use male thin, average, and hulk bodies
- Lower psysic sens. (from .75 to .4)
- Less negot. ability (from .9 to .75)

These changes are all based on my personal preferences and are what I prefer to play with in-game. This mod is mainly for myself, but I decided to post it in case anyone else has the same perspective I do.

I wanted to make the persona mechs more thematically accurate and fitting, even if it meant sacrificing balance to a reasonable extent. I'm wary to change anything further, but I'll consider any suggestions I get.
