Patch to make various changes to mech pawns from "Persona Mechanoid Pawns":

- Mechs don't need sleep
- Disable comfort need (comfort bar still shows but pawn does not incur mood penalties from it)
- Persona mechs only use male thin, average, and hulk bodies
- Lower psysic sens.
- Less negot. ability

These changes are all based on my personal preferences and are what I prefer to play with in-game. This mod is mainly for myself, but I decided to post it in case anyone else has the same perspective I do.
